# Amap_web_crawling
Amap (Gaode Map) offers a 2.5D vector building model of high accuracy and covers most major cities in China. However, this data could only be viewed via tAmap's web API but not directly downloaded. To have an insight into the recent development in China, this project aims to explore methods that could acquire Amap's building data.
